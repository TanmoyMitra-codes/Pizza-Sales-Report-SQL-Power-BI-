🍕 Pizza Store Sales Analysis – MySQL & Power BI Project
Welcome to my second Power BI project! In this analysis, I explored detailed sales data from a pizza store using MySQL for data management and Power BI for data visualization. The goal of this project is to derive actionable insights that can help optimize business decisions and understand customer preferences.

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a pizza store to answer key business questions such as:

What are the total revenue and total pizzas sold?

Which pizzas are the best and worst selling?

Which categories and sizes are most popular among customers?

What are the busiest times and days for orders?

🛠 Tools & Technologies
Power BI – for building interactive dashboards and visual reports

MySQL – for querying and preprocessing the dataset

Microsoft Excel – for initial data formatting and sharing

Power Query – used within Power BI for data cleaning and transformation

📊 Dataset Information
The dataset includes over 48,000 records of pizza orders with the following fields:

Column	Description
pizza_id	Unique identifier for each pizza sold
order_id	Order identifier
pizza_name_id	Internal name ID of the pizza
quantity	Quantity sold
order_date	Date of the order
order_time	Time of the order
unit_price	Price per pizza
total_price	Total price = unit price × quantity
pizza_size	Size of the pizza (S, M, L, XL, XXL)
pizza_category	Category (Classic, Veggie, Supreme, etc.)
pizza_ingredients	Ingredients list
pizza_name	Full name of the pizza

📈 Key Insights
Here are some major takeaways from the analysis:

Total Revenue: $817,860.05

Total Pizzas Sold: 49,574

Top-Selling Pizza: The Classic Deluxe Pizza

Most Popular Category: Classic

These insights were visualized using Power BI in various formats like bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to make them easy to understand for stakeholders.
